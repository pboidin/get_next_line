How it's ever so funny, cause i don't thinks you're special, i don't thinks you're cool, you're just probably alright, but unbder these lights you look beautiful, and i'm struggling, i can't see through your fake tan, yeah, and you know it for the fact that everybody's eating out of your hands. But what do you know ? Oh you know NOTHING
Yeah, but i'll still take you home
